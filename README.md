- Check out this repository and run `npm install`, then `npm run graphqldoc`.
- Make sure the static pages generated under `/docs` look okay, then commit and push.
- That's it! You should see your changes here once your changes reach the master branch: https://codesignal.github.io/graphql-api-docs/index.html
