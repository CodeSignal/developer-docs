# CodeSignal GraphQL API Docs

Generated with graphqldoc:
https://github.com/codesignal/graphqldoc

To generate documentation:
- Check out the main repository containing the GraphQL server.
- Run it the usual way so that GraphQL is accessible here: http://localhost:3000/graphql
- Check out this repository and run `npm install`, then `npm run build`.
- Make sure the static pages generated under `/docs` look okay, then commit and push.
- That's it! You should see your changes here once your changes reach the master branch: https://codesignal.github.io/graphql-api-docs/index.html

You can also view the documentation site locally by running `npm start` -- you just need to have Python 2 installed on your local machine.
The start script serves the docs here: http://localhost:8000
