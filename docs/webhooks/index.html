                    <h3>What is a webhook?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A webhook is a way to receive an event notification from a server.
                        When certain events occur in CodeSignal, a JSON payload containing information about the event will be sent via an HTTP POST request
                        to a specified endpoint URL.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What information is needed to create a webhook?</h3>
                    <div>
                        Each webhook needs the following information:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Endpoint URL</strong>: The URL to which the webhook will send its POST payloads.
                                This must be a valid URL that returns a 200 HTTP status after receiving each POST.
                                When the webhook is created or updated, the URL will be POSTed with an empty payload, which must return a 200 status code within 5 seconds
                                in order to successfully create or update the webhook.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Event types</strong>: The list of events the webhook will be notified about.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Secret key</strong>: (optional) The secret key is a string used to generate a signature header that you can use to verify that the webhook data came from CodeSignal.
                                The secret key is used in conjunction with the webhook's payload to generate a digital signature.
                                Although it is not strictly required, we strongly encourage use of the secret key to verify that webhooks are actually coming from our platform.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Owner emails</strong>: (optional) If the webhook cannot deliver its payload to the endpoint URL successfully, we will
                                send a notification email to every provided email address. Read more about the retry policy below.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>Signature</h3>
                    <p>
                        For webhooks with a secret key, CodeSignal will sign every request with a <span class="mono">X-CodeSignal-Signature</span> HTTP header, generated using the following algorithim:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>getSignature(secretKey, endpointUrl, { eventType = '', triggeredOn = '' }) {
  const plainText = `${endpointUrl}${eventType}${triggeredOn}`;
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey);
  hash.update(plainText);
  return hash.digest('hex');
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Here, <span class="mono">triggeredOn</span> is the timestamp present in every event payload.
                    </p>
